*Growth Mindset*
>**What does growth mindset mean to me?**
1. Vunerable to not knowing - I don't always have to know the answers. I struggle with this as a teacher. I always feel uncomfortable with not knowing the information they need.
2. Keep trying - I have been trying to wrap my head around javascript for awhile now. I wish it came easy for me but it doesn't.
3. Humble myself - I often have to ask a lot of questions, and some are simple and easy, but I need to do that to process information.
