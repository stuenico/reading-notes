1. What is an expression in JavaScript?
    - an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.
2. Why would we use a loop in our code?
    - If we want to repeat a section of code and add something in addition to it. 
3. When does a for loop stop executing?
    - When a statement evaluates to false it will stop the loop. As long as the statement is true, the loop will continue. 
4. How many times will a while loop execute?
    - As long as the statement is true, the loop will continue.
