# Notes on Class 1

### [Get Started Notes](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/):
  #### Markdown is a quick and simple way to create a text to look like HTML without using tags. It uses symbols to create common formats like bold, italics, bullets and numbering. It is versitle and easy to make notes with any markdown editor. You can quickly format text without knowing the HTML code for the method. 

### [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/):
  #### Basic Syntax is a great resource that demonstrates simple Markdown codes. It lists common formats like bullets, bold, italics, quotes, numbering, images and links. The Markdown symbols are displayed along with the HTML code. The resource also displays how the text would appear with the Markdown tools. It also gives a list of do's and don'ts incase changes are not appearing with the Markdown elements. 

### [Mastering Markdown on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) :
  #### Mastering Markdown is probably my preferred resouce link. It demonstrates how to use Markdown elements to change colors, add images, emojis, and links. It also explains vocabulary like Relative Links. This is where you can link a file in your repository. The relative link is a link to the connected to the current file.
