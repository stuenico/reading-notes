2. #### Why do we use Markdown? It is a quick and easy way to format text for a web page without using HTML tags. Tags have to go in the front and end of most text on a page, therefore there can be a great deal of code that needs to be used to make a simple format change. It is necessary sometimes to use a 'shorthand' version to edit a webpage.
